My practice investigates the intersection between organic forms and human intervention. Through ceramics, I explore themes of growth, decay, and transformation. Each piece emerges from a dialogue between material and process, where the inherent properties of clay inform the final form.

Drawing inspiration from biological structures and natural phenomena, my work seeks to blur the line between the manufactured and the naturally occurring. The resulting pieces exist in a space between recognition and abstraction, inviting viewers to question their relationship with the natural world.
