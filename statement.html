    <p>My practice investigates the intersection between organic forms and human intervention. Through ceramics, I explore themes of growth, decay, and transformation. Each piece emerges from a dialogue between material and process, where the inherent properties of clay inform the final form.</p>
    
    <p>Drawing inspiration from biological structures and natural phenomena, my work seeks to blur the line between the manufactured and the naturally occurring. The resulting pieces exist in a space between recognition and abstraction, inviting viewers to question their relationship with the natural world.</p>
